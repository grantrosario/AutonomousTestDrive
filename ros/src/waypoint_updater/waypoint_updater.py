'''
This node will publish waypoints from the car's current position to some `x` distance ahead.
As mentioned in the doc, you should ideally first implement a version which does not care
about traffic lights or obstacles.
Once you have created dbw_node, you will update this node to use the status of traffic lights too.
Please note that our simulator also provides the exact location of traffic lights and their
current status in `/vehicle/traffic_lights` message. You can use this message to build this node
as well as to verify your TL classifier.
TODO (for Yousuf and Aaron): Stopline location for each traffic light.
